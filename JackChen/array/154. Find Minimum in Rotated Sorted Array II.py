Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.
