Abondon previous progresses on Leetcode and start a new session.
Begin with **Arrary**.

### 1. Two Sum -- Trade Space for Time
My first try uses 2 while loop, whose time complexity is o(N^2), but got **"Time Limit Exceeded"**.
Then I realize, for integers, without the limit for space usage, we can easily achieve o(N) time comlexity with o(N) space complexity.
OK. Do remember this trick for INTEGERS. Same idea behind **Count Search**.
