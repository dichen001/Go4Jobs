Begin with Arrary. ` +3(1*, 27, 189), now 3/77.`

#### 1. Two Sum -- Trade Space for Time
My first try uses 2 while loop, whose time complexity is o(N^2), but got **"Time Limit Exceeded"**.
Then I realize, for integers, without the limit for space usage, we can easily achieve o(N) time comlexity with o(N) space complexity.
OK. Do remember this trick for INTEGERS. Same idea behind **Count Search**.

`+4 (217, 219, 283, 396*)`

#### 396. Rotate Function -- Math matters...
Finding the fomula changes O(N^2) to O(N)
