/*You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Follow up:
Could you do this in-place?
*/

/*
Solution in Discussion:
ONE:
The idea was firstly transpose the matrix and then flip it symmetrically. For instance,

1  2  3             
4  5  6
7  8  9
after transpose, it will be swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i])

1  4  7
2  5  8
3  6  9
Then flip the matrix horizontally. (swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[i][matrix.length-1-j])

7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3

TWO:
/*
 * clockwise rotate
 * first reverse up to down, then swap the symmetry 
 * 1 2 3     7 8 9     7 4 1
 * 4 5 6  => 4 5 6  => 8 5 2
 * 7 8 9     1 2 3     9 6 3
*/

/*
 * anticlockwise rotate
 * first reverse left to right, then swap the symmetry
 * 1 2 3     3 2 1     3 6 9
 * 4 5 6  => 6 5 4  => 2 5 8
 * 7 8 9     9 8 7     1 4 7
